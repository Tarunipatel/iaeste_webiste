		        	Directorate of International and Collaborations (DoIC) is an endeavor of Manipal University Jaipur headed by the Director, assisted by Deputy Director and Assistant Dirctor, and supported by Nodal Officers. Established to promote internationalization and expose students to the global scenario, we endorse IAESTE India LC MUJ,  which assists students in bagging internships in 80+ countries. DoIC is delighted to present the Newsletter of IAESTE India LC MUJ, where all the ongoing activities of the organization would be shared. Amidst the global pandemic, which has posed a significant challenge to mobility, this great step would initialize a positive flow of ideas among the present and past students of Manipal University Jaipur. It's time to bounce back and grab the opportunities that IAESTE provides to promote the mission and vision of IAESTE.<br><br>Further, we would like to congratulate IAESTE on celebrating its 72nd IAESTE Day. IAESTE, as an organization, has worked tirelessly to provide the best technical and cultural experiences to the students. We would especially like to appreciate IAESTE India LC MUJ for efficiently tackling the problems faced due to the pandemic and provide the best possible internships to the students of Manipal University Jaipur.<br><br>Wishing IAESTE and LC MUJ more prosperous years to come.<br><br>

		<p id="iday">The COVID-19 pandemic came out of the blue and brought life to a virtual standstill. We are fortunate enough to have been blessed with such innovative technologies that can bring two people 1000s of miles away together in just a fraction of seconds.<br><br>At IAESTE, we firmly believe that when the roots are deep, there is no reason to fear the wind, and Alumni is a strong force that binds us with our roots of wisdom and expertise. It's been a long time, but it's never late to share our experiences, memories, and wisdom with each other.<br><br>To celebrate the spirit of IAESTE, all the wonderful people and experiences, we called upon our alumni for a virtual get-together, and to say the least, it was nostalgic. It was all about sharing experiences, the fun that our alumni had during their internships, and the friends they made along the way. The meet focused on how IAESTE had brought out the best in our alumni and how IAESTE is truly "Work! Experience! Discover!"<br><br>Achintya Mohan, former President, IAESTE India LC MUJ (2015-16), shares his experience, "The time in the LC will teach you skills that will be invaluable for you in your career ahead. And an internship abroad will not only broaden your horizons in your technical field but also help you in becoming a truly global citizen. IAESTE will leave you with a bucket full of memories, which will make you nostalgic for all the years to come. So if you are willing to carry this albatross around your neck for the rest of your life, aboard the ship, close your eyes, and let the IAESTE magic begin!"<br><br>It was a walk down the memory lane to relive the IAESTE days and celebrate the IAESTE essence.

		<p class="about-remote">
			What will the world look like after the COVID-19 pandemic? How will it shape the work and markets? - these are the questions popping up more and more, as slowly economies are opening up from lockdown, and people are trying to position themselves in this new reality.<br><br>

            Remote working has been a growing trend in the workforce in recent years. However, until now, it has not been widely adopted. The COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent social isolation measures have caused companies to explore remote working options and implement collaborative tools in an attempt to sustain their business through the crisis.

            <i><b>The home office isn't a just benefit anymore. Being able to work remotely is a new reality.</b></i><br><br>

        </p>
        <p id="about-remote-para">
            The current scenario creates challenges and hardships for everyone, but the world is much more open to remote work and overcome the difficulties and losses due to the pandemic. To overcome the challenges, IAESTE  came up with an alternative approach- IAESTE Remote Internships.<br><br>

            IAESTE Remote Internships gives you a chance to form international friendships and gain valuable work experience. At the heart of IAESTE Remote Internships lies quality. Each internship is created and defined in such a way as to ensure giving students valuable work experience. As always, we care about each trainee and provide social and intercultural experience online and at home. <br><br>  

            Reet Nandy, an Outgoing Intern, shares his Remote Internship Experience, "Connecting me with people from across the world even in the middle of a pandemic, is what IAESTE did for me. I was not only given the opportunity to work under experienced faculties but even let me expose myself to a different culture and new experiences. IAESTE Experience is something that cannot be explained but needs to be felt." <br><br>

            IAESTE Remote Internships are an additional way, alongside IAESTE's world-known internship exchange program, to connect even more students and employers and build bridges between cultures by using the latest technologies.
            <br><br>
             So, tune in, and get ready to experience the best. Join IAESTE today!

		    			IAESTE has helped me develop my overall professional skills. I have worked for four years in IAESTE and was privileged to get a once in a lifetime opportunity to represent LC Manipal University Jaipur in front of 80+ countries at the Annual General Conference of IAESTE in Cyprus. I have been to a couple of internships in Prague, which has provided me a lot of confidence. It's as we say, IAESTE leaves you speechless and later turns you into a story-teller.

		    			It has been a valuable experience working at the University of Ibagué, Colombia. I got a chance to interact with IAESTE Colombia and many fellow interns from across the globe. We shared our traditions, cultures, and values. Mr. Manuel Guillermo Forero Vargas, my mentor, and professor at the university, has been a great inspiration and a guide, helping us in our research throughout. Although it was a remote internship, it has been a great experience, and I look forward to working here again. IAESTE is truly, "Work! Experience! Discover!"

		    			It’s been a unique experience, I’ve done a couple of internships before, but this one wasn’t like anything I’ve ever done. Through this internship, I’ve learned so much that my research skills are now much better. Even though my official internship has finished, I’m still working with my faculty on publishing a conference and a journal paper that I am very excited about. People at IAESTE MUJ are very welcoming and helpful. They worked with me through many communication and technical problems, and I believe some even became good friends through the online meetings we held.
